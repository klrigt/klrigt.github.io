    "    League of Legends (LoL) is a fast-paced, competitive Multiplayer Online Battle Arena (MOBA) video game developed and published by Riot Games in 2009. The game's user-friendly interface, variety of champions, and competitive and strategic nature as just some of the many reasons League of Legends has gained popularity over the years, acquiring on average 27 million active players a day. Riot Games established the first World Championship series in 2011 and in only two years, had 32 millions viewers tuned in to watch the game, compared to the 15.1 million who watched the NBA Finals in that year. It is undeniable that the gaining popularity of League of Legends helped push the rise of Esports. League of Legends continues to grow, bringing in a larger fan-base and revenue with each passing year.<br> <br>\n",
    "    Although the game offers several game modes, the Championship Series utilizes the classic game mode. Two teams of five compete to destroy each other's Nexus located at the enemy's base. The map is composed of three lanes, top, mid, and bottom, as well as a jungle spread throughout the middle of the map (as shown in the figure below).Each team has five different positions, Top, Mid, Bottom, Support, and Jungle. Each team member chooses to play from a vast selection of champions with their own unique skills and strengths. (More information regarding the rules can be found <a href=\"https://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/featured/new-player-guide?source=https://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/site/guide/#/?_k=l5hkd0 \">here</a>)      \n",
    "    <img src=\"lol_map.jpeg\",width=500,height=500> <br>\n",
    "    The different positions, strategies, and champions can make the game difficult to understand, but when mastered, players can be rewarded immensely. The championship series rewards the winning team over five million dollars and the average player makes a six-figure income. In this tutorial, our goal is to tidy in-game data of professional league players in the World Championship Series from 2015-2018. We will then analyze the data in order to find the Top 5 Players for each team position as well as find any trends in their statistics that help with improving their win rates. We hope our analysis of the game sparks an interest for people unfamiliar with League of Legends. We also hope to shed a light on the intricacies behind winning a game in League of Legends. <br>\n",
